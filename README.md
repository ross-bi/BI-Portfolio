#  Business Intelligence Portfolio — Ross
Welcome to my Business Intelligence (BI) portfolio. This repository showcases my end‑to‑end analytics capabilities across SQL, Python, Power BI, Tableau, data modeling, and business insights. It reflects my transition from operations and coordination work into a BI‑focused career through continuous learning, hands‑on projects, and real business applications.

# About Me
I am a Business Intelligence & Operations Coordinator based in Hong Kong, with over four years of experience in a small trading company environment.

Professional background:

- Company size: 5‑person trading company
- Responsibilities included:

My journey reflects a practical, business‑driven approach to BI: solving real operational problems with data.
