#  Business Intelligence Portfolio — Ross Tang
Welcome to my Business Intelligence (BI) portfolio. This repository showcases my end‑to‑end analytics capabilities across SQL, Python, Power BI, Tableau, data modeling, and business insights. It reflects my transition from operations and coordination work into a BI‑focused career through continuous learning, hands‑on projects, and real business applications.

# About Me

- Current role: Business Intelligence & Operations Coordinator (since Oct 2025)
- Previous role: Sales & Shipping Coordinator (2021–2025)
- Company size: A small trading company in Hong Kong
###  Responsibilities included:
- Building and maintaining warehouse tracking systems in Excel
- Preparing import/export documents, invoices, packing lists
- Managing bonded tobacco permits and license renewals

- Sales reporting using Excel Pivot Tables
- From 2025 onward: creating Power BI dashboards connected to NAS‑hosted Excel sales data
My journey reflects a practical, business‑driven approach to BI: solving real operational problems with data.
